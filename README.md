# The goal is to develop a statistical model that allows you to predict exposure to a hypothetical toxicant (assessed using urinary concentration of the toxicant as an exposure biomarker) based on other variables that would be easier to measure. After you develop your predictive model, you will evaluate your predictions using the file Evaluation.xlsx, which represents independent measurements on a different group of workers.
